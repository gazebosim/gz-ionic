# Gazebo Ionic Highlights

## New Features

- [Add new console logging functionality based on `spdlog`](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-common/pull/615).
  Also see [gz-utils#134](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-utils/pull/134)

  - Console logging has been reimplemented using `spdlog`. While the existing
    macros such as `gzerr`, `gzwarn`, and `gzmsg` continue to work as before,
    you can now get access to the raw `spdlog` logger, which provides greater
    control and flexibility. A new macro, `gztrace` is also provided, which can
    be useful in debugging or data collection scenarios. With `spdlog`, you also
    get the ability to use format strings. Here's a quick example:

    ```c++
    auto logger = gz::common::Console::Root().RawLoggerPtr();
    logger->trace("Ï€ to 5th decimal = {:.5f}\n", M_PI);
    ```

- Improvements to the bullet-featherstone physics plugin

  - Many new features and bugfixes were made to the bullet-featherstone plugin
    in gz-physics, which include support for nested models,
    off-diagonal inertia, enforcing joint velocity and effort limits,
    configuring solver iterations, and more. There are also features for
    performance improvements and physics stability such as auto-deactivation,
    static object collision optimization, and use of convex hull shapes for
    convex decomposed meshes.

- [Support for mesh optimization](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/pull/2417),
[gzsim#2352](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/pull/2352),
[gz-common#585](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-common/pull/585),
[sdformat#1382](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-common/pull/585), and
[gz-physics#606](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-physics/pull/606)

  - Added support for mesh optimization on the collision mesh. Users can now
    specify whether or not to perform mesh optimization on a
    collision mesh in SDF (requires SDF spec version >= 1.11). Two optimization
    methods are currently supported: `convex_decomposition` and `convex_hull`.
    Gazebo uses the open source
    [V-HACD](https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd) library to perform
    convex decomposition to split the mesh into multiple submeshes.
    Example SDF usage:

    ```xml
    <collision>
      <mesh optimization="convex_decomposition">
        <convex_decomposition>
          <max_convex_hulls>16</max_convex_hulls>
          <voxel_resolution>400000</voxel_resolution>
        </convex_decomposition>
        <uri>/path/to/mesh.dae</uri>
      </mesh>
    </collision>
    ```

- [Support specifying plugins in SDF files without overriding default
  plugins](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/pull/2497) and [gz-gui#631](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-gui/pull/631)

  - In prior Gazebo versions, if a user specified a server plugin at the
    world level, it would override all default plugins. This required
    users to have in-depth knowledge and specify every plugin necessary
    for a simulation to run correctly. Omitting critical plugins would
    lead to unexpected simulation behavior, causing confusion,
    particularly for new Gazebo users.

  - Gazebo Ionic addresses this issue by loading default plugins even when
    users specify additional plugins. Gazebo Ionic also introduces
    `<gz:policy>` settings to revert this behavior to how it functioned in
    previous Gazebo versions, if desired.  For example, the
    `contact_sensor.sdf` example can now include just the additional Contact
    system:

    ```xml
    <world name="contact_sensor">
      <plugin filename="gz-sim-contact-system" name="gz::sim::systems::Contact"/>
      ...
    </world>

    ```

    whereas previously, the SDF file has all the default plugins:

    ```xml
    <world name="contact_sensor">
      <plugin
        filename="gz-sim-physics-system"
        name="gz::sim::systems::Physics">
      </plugin>
      <plugin
        filename="gz-sim-contact-system"
        name="gz::sim::systems::Contact">
      </plugin>
      <plugin
        filename="gz-sim-user-commands-system"
        name="gz::sim::systems::UserCommands">
      </plugin>
      <plugin
        filename="gz-sim-scene-broadcaster-system"
        name="gz::sim::systems::SceneBroadcaster">
      </plugin>

      ...
    </world>

    ```

- Improvements to gz-transport CLI ergonomics and extra option to ignore local messages.
See [gz-transport#477](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-transport/pull/477), [gz-transport#486](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-transport/pull/486), [gz-transport#487](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-transport/pull/487) and [gz-transport#506](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-transport/pull/506/).

  - An extra option has been added to the `SubscriberOptions` class allowing the ability to ignore messages when publisher
  and subscriber share the same node. This feature was particularly interesting to avoid loops in the `ros_gz` bridge.
  See more context [here](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/issues/555).

  - Most of the gz-transport functionality can be exercised via command line with the `gz topic` or `gz service` subcommands.
  We've reduced the amount of typing needed to request certain services from CLI. Here's a summary:
    - Gazebo Ionic allows to request one-way service requests directly from the command line. In prior Gazebo versions, users
    had to specify `--reptype gz.msgs.Empty ` to simulate one-way service requests.
    - The synchronous service requests have now a default timeout, reducing the amount of typing from the CLI.
    - Gazebo Ionic allows to request no-input service requests directly from the command line. In prior Gazebo versions, users
    had to specify `--reqtype gz.msgs.Empty ` to simulate no-input service requests.


## Bug Fixes

## Breaking Changes

## Documentation

- [Improved Gazebo Documentation Website](https://github.com/gazebosim/docs/pull/441)
  - The main documentation [website](https://gazebosim.org/docs) has been
    migrated to a statically generated site built with
    [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org/). This adds a number of features and solves
    a number of problems with the previous website, namely:
    - Documentation authors can easily preview their changes by downloading the
      generated website instead of having to set up a local development
      environment
    - The website is updated automatically instead of being manually triggered
      after each PR.
    - Search functionality is now available
    - Improved layout and UX on mobile devices
    - Dark and light modes
    - Improved SEO as the content is now more easily accessible to search
      engines.
    - Use of Sphinx as a common documentation tool for both Gazebo and ROS.
